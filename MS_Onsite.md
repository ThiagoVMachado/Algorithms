### **First Round**

✔ In a binary tree, if in the path from root to the node A, there is no node with greater value than A’s, this node A is visible. We need to count the number of visible nodes in a binary tree. :orange_book:

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
        5
     /    \
    3     10
  /  \    /
20   21  1

Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 visible nodes: 5, 20, 21, and 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
  -10
    \
    -15
       \
       -1

Output: 2
Explanation: Visible nodes are -10 and -1.
```

[SOLUTION T = O(n) | M = O(1)](https://pastebin.com/2yy7NMwL)

### **Second Round**

✔ [Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-n-unique-integers-sum-up-to-zero/) :green_book: [SOLUTION T = O(n) | M = O(1)](https://pastebin.com/WuA4pz5x)

### **Third Round**

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. :orange_book:

Array A represents a linked list. A list is constructed from this array as follows:

• the first node (the head) is located at index 0;

• the value of a node located at index K is ```A[K]```;

• the successor of a node located at index K is located at index ```A[K + 1]```;

• if the value of a node is −1 then it is the last node of the list. For example, for array A such that: 

```
A[0] = 1
A[1] = 4
A[2] = -1
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 2
```

the following list is constructed:

• the first node (the head) is located at index 0 and has a value of 1;

• the second node is located at index 1 and has a value of 4;

• the third node is located at index 4 and has a value of 2;

• the fourth node is located at index 2 and has a value of −1.


Write a function:

int FindLength (int[] A);

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the length of the list constructed from A in the above manner.

For example, given array A such that:

```
A[0] = 1
A[1] = 4
A[2] = -1
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 2
```
the function should return 4, as explained in the example above.

The below are the assumptions that helps you to solve the problem:

• N is an integer within the range ```[1..200,000]```;

• each element of array A is an integer within the range ```[−1..200,000]```;

• it will always be possible to construct the list and its length will be finite.
